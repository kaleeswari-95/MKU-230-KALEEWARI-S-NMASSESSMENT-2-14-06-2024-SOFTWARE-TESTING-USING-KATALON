About N.M.S.S.V.C




The golden pages of history witnessed an educational revolution in the year 1993 with the inception of N.M.S.Sermathai Vasan College for women, by Nadar Mahajana Sangam with a mission to uplift the educational status of women in and around madurai. The college was named after the benevolent philanthropist Thiru. V.G.Vasan, and Thirumathi Sermathai Vasan, who believed the empowerment of women is through knowledge and economic independence. The hand that rocks the cradle can rock the world is the vision of V.P.R. Gangaram Durairaj, the founder of the college. The college is presently run by Nadar mahajana sangam, and hails its preeminent status among several educational institutions run by the Nadar Mahajana Sangam by providing quality and task based learning environment. The college is housed at the outskirts of madurai in a serene and spacious environment and permanently affiliated to Madurai Kamaraj University.

At present the college has 1660 students offering wide array of 12 UG academic courses and 6 PG courses. This Himalayan development is due to the strength of the diligent and compendious faculty of the college which rises to 86 teaching and 25 non teaching staff. To update the students with the latest global scenario the college has a stellar library separately housed with reading rooms and E-learning facility. The library has volume of books and also subscribes to national and international journals. Apart from the regular academic courses, the college also offers university diploma certificate courses and institutional certificate courses to mould the students competent enough to succeed in the survival of the fittest global work culture.The college acts as a catalyst to limelight the hidden talents of the students by having 18 clubs apart from the regular NCC, NSS, YRC and RRC.
